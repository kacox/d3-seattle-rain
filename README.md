# Repository for D3 Seattle Rain Visualization

See the visualization directly here: https://kacox.github.io/d3-seattle-rain/

## Summary
This visualization shows the average number of rainy days in Seattle,
Washington per month. Summer months experience less rain than the winter
months. Using Python (Pandas), I distilled this information from a larger
dataset. The original dataset contains weather information for 25,551
consecutive days spanning from 1948 to 2017 collected at the Seattle-Tacoma
International Airport (SeaTac, Washington, U.S., just south of Seattle).


## Design
I considered two different types of bar plots when developing this
visualization. I initially thought of using a bar chart with two grouped bars
per month, one representing the number of rain days and the other the number
of non-rain days. For my first visualization draft I instead made a
stacked bar chart. I thought that would be more effective at emphasizing the
proportion rather than absolute number of days. My first feedback volunteer
was not impressed by the stacked bar chart, so I reverted to my original
design idea.


## Feedback
**Feedback #1**  
_What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?_  
Seattle has less rain in the summer months. Seattle generally seems like a wet
location: even in the driest month, there are 5 rain days, about 1 per week.

_What questions do you have about the data?_  
What constitutes a rainy day?

_Things to improve:_  
Reword the first sentence of the Summary, it is confusing.  
Have a blurb saying how to see the visualization directly as a web page.  
Change the tooltip; having "rain: Rain" is redundant.

_Suggestions:_  
I'm not convinced that a stacked bar chart is better than a side by side bar
chart.

**Feedback #2**  
_What do you notice in the visualization?_  
We notice that there's a clear trend between the time of the month and how
much rain we see in Seattle.

_What questions do you have about the data?_  
Based on the visualization alone, it's hard to know, what constitutes a rainy
day? I assume it's likely based on the amount of precipitation in a day.

I'm also interested in knowing what the original dataset looks like and how
many data points do we have in a day.

_What relationships do you notice?_  
We notice that Seattle sees more rain in winter months as compared to summer.

_What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?_  
That we see more rain in winter as compared to summer

_Is there something you donâ€™t understand in the graphic?_  
No, the visualization is quite clear.

_Suggestions:_  
Give more details on what the dataset looks like and how many data points are
present in a day.

Indicate what classifies as a rainy vs non-rainy day.

**Columns:**  
    DATE = the date of the observation in the format (Year-Month-Day)  
    PRCP = the amount of precipitation, in inches (decimal)  
    TMAX = the maximum temperature for that day, in degrees Fahrenheit  
    TMIN = the minimum temperature for that day, in degrees Fahrenheit  
    RAIN = TRUE if rain was observed on that day, FALSE if it was not
